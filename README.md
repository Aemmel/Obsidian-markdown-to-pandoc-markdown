# Obsidian markdown to pandoc markdown

Obsidian plugin to convert an 'Obsidian-flavored' markdown file to a markdown+LaTeX Hybrid which can be converted to PDF via pandoc.
Most importantly, internal links are translated correctly, while external links stay as they are with the double bracket notation [[...]].

TODO: at some point, I would like to implement the correct handling of external links, such that they get implemented as the appendix. Shouldn't be too difficult with the scaffolding I have in place.
