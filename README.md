# Obsidian markdown to pandoc markdown

This is a plugin for the Obsidian markdown editor.
The idea of this plugin is to allow for a good conversion of notes to PDF via pandoc. It creates a new note in a temporary location with not only the file's contents but also the contents of the linked files/sections/equations. 
This is converted to a pandoc ready format and pandoc is invoked to convert it into a nice looking PDF.
